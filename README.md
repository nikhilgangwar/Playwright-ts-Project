Playwright Demo Project
Welcome to my Playwright demo project! This repository contains a demonstration of using Playwright for browser automation and testing. Playwright is a powerful tool for automating interactions with web browsers, making it ideal for testing web applications, scraping data, or any other tasks that involve programmatically interacting with web pages.
